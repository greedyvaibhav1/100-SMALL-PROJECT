        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>The Alaska Waterfalls page focuses on the waterfalls that we’ve personally visited in the largest state of the United States. Although you wouldn’t know it from looking at the waterfall map above, I’m sure these waterfalls are abundant given the state’s rainy climate. In fact, it’s said to rain about 300 days out of the year in much of the southeast part of Alaska alone!

            However, given the wild and ruggedness of this harsh and unforgiving yet bountiful land, it’s going to take work, a lot of money, and/or a lot of preparation to visit them. So far in our experience, we have only managed to see a few of them on an Alaska Cruise that only covered the southeast of the state.</p>
